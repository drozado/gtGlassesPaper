Introduction
\end{center}
}

%We should clearify that this paper does not contribute in the hand gesture recognition but it uses the gesture and gaze in
% a mobile situation for controlling a robot.

Method
\end{center}
}

% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\noindent The method section of the extended summary should include information about participants, apparatus,
materials, procedure and analyses.
At a maximum you may use two full pages. Use the predefined format of this template and do not change the format in any
respect. For example, do not change the margins, font, font size, spacing between lines for either headers or text.
All sections (method, results and conclusion) need to be considered. But you are free to choose how much text you want
to include in each of these sections. If you are submitting a theoretical paper you may change the headers of the
sections method and results to something more appropriate.
If you need to include references in the extended summary they should follow APA standards and be included in full in
the text in square brackets, e.g., [Author, X. (2000). My amazing paper. \emph{Journal of Amazingology}, 3(21), pp.
1-2]. The extended summary is the basis for the reviewers. Notification of abstract acceptance for talks will be sent April 15
2013. We cannot guarantee that we will respect the authors' preferences for oral or poster presentation. Some talks may
be offered as poster presentations instead.

Results

%---------------------------------------------------------------
\noindent
The results section of the extended summary should include the results of your study. You may insert tables and figures. Table 1 illustrates the style of a table. The factors, conditions and values are fictive. The table caption should be located above the table. Do not insert more than one table and more than one figure.

\begin{table}[\!ht]
	\centering
	\caption{This is a caption for the table}
	\vskip 0.12in
		\begin{tabular}{lcc}
			\hline
				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{Factor 2} \\
					\cline{2-3}
						Factor 1 & Condition A & Condition B \\
						\hline
						First  & 23(11) & 49(10) \\
						Second   & 22(12)  & 12(15) \\
						\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\label{ECEMtableTemplate}
\end{table}

For figures, use PNG, PSD, TIFF, BMP or JPG with a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. Figure 1 illustrates the style of a figure. The figure caption should be located below the figure.

\begin{figure}[h]
