abstract = {Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology
for human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have
stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday
applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability,
and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have
developed the \{openEyes\} system. The system consists of an open-hardware
design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost
off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools
for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking
applications. We expect that the availability of this system will
facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual
integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday
human computer interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges
of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced
our current system.},

@article{Rozado2012b,
abstract = {Sign language recognition, SLR, using spatial positions and arrangements of the hands over time is a challenging multi-variable time series recognition problem with several potential applications. Here we explore, for SLR purposes, a hierarchically connected network of nodes based on a Bayesian-like paradigm known as hierarchical temporal memory, HTM, that models neocortical principles of organization and information coding. HTM is a broad paradigm for pattern recognition, control, attention and forward prediction that exploits the hierarchy in time and space existing in the physical world during both learning and inference. In this work we focus on HTM capabilities for pattern recognition. We extend the traditional HTM paradigm with an original top node in order to improve HTMs performance in problems where instances unfold over time. The extended top node stores and compares sequences of spatio-temporally codified inputs to handle the temporal evolution of instances in sign language. Sequence comparison is carried out using the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment that employs dynamic programming. We compare the performance of the extended HTM with traditional HTMs and machine learning algorithms routinely used in the literature for SLR. The extended HTM improves performance of traditional HTM for SLR, reaching 91\% recognition accuracy for a data set of 95 categories of Australian sign language. When sufficient training instances are available, the extended HTM matches or outperforms state of the art methods for SLR such as Hidden Markov Models or Metafeatures T-Classes without the usage of a language model, nor pre-processing of sensor data. The extended HTM employs relatively small feature vectors in comparison to methods in the literature. Our method learns the spatio-temporal data structures and transitions that occur in the data without depending on manually predefined features to be searched for and works well in real time. These results suggest that the extended HTM approach is a valid bioinspired alternative to existing SLR engines and that it can be successfully applied to other machine learning tasks whose input instances also unfold over time.},

@article{hopfield,
abstract = {Highly-interconnected networks of nonlinear analog neurons are shown to be extremely effective in computing. The networks can rapidly provide a collectively-computed solution (a digital output) to a problem on the basis of analog input information. The problems to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired optima, often subject to constraints. The general principles involved in constructing networks to solve specific problems are discussed. Results of computer simulations of a network designed to solve a difficult but well-defined optimization problem-the Traveling-Salesman Problem-are presented and used to illustrate the computational power of the networks. Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity. The power and speed naturally displayed by such collective networks may contribute to the effectiveness of biological information processing.},

A twenty three-point questionnaire was distributed to 476 children in first to eighth grade from three parochial schools in one of the New York City boroughs. The findings of this study suggest that children use the computer and electronic games differently than adults and that more boys than girls engage in electronic game playing. Results clearly indicated that children are experiencing discomfort from the use of computers or electronic games, and that the discomfort is largely concentrated in the neck region. Occupational therapy could be instrumental in terms of educating the children, their parents/guardians, and their teachers on proper body mechanics, applications of ergonomically suited workstations, and the use of rest/stretch breaks while engaged in computing and electronic game playing.},

abstract = {Discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns is a fundamental aim of statistical inference or learning. One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways. Discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns is a fundamental aim of statistical inference or learning. One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways.},

@article{Negin2000,
abstract = {Much work in the emerging field of biometrics has focused on identification applications. Biometrics offers the means to identify individuals without requiring that they carry ID cards and badges or memorize passwords. A leading concern in the development of such applications, however, is how to avoid rejecting valid users or approving imposters. The iris of the eye may provide a solution by offering a much more discriminating biometric than fingerprint or face recognition. The authors have designed and implemented an iris biometric system for personal electronic identification. Further, their system solves problems associated with public use devices such as automated teller machines, where habituated use is not the norm. The system also addresses personal-use arenas, such as home banking, and other Internet and network applications, such as secure business logons. The article describes the public- and personal-use systems, as well as relating statistical analysis and field trials to gauge the effectiveness of their system},

abstract = {Abstract. We introduce, analyze and demonstrate a recursive hierarchical generalization of the widely used hidden Markov models, which we name Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMM). Our model is motivated by the complex multi-scale structure which appears in many natural sequences, particularly in language, handwriting and speech. We seek a systematic unsupervised approach to the modeling of such structures. By extending the standard Baum-Welch (forwardbackward) algorithm, we derive an efficient procedure for estimating the model parameters from unlabeled data. We then use the trained model for automatic hierarchical parsing of observation sequences. We describe two applications of our model and its parameter estimation procedure. In the first application we show how to construct hierarchical models of natural English text. In these models different levels of the hierarchy correspond to structures on different length scales in the text. In the second application we demonstrate how HHMMs can be used to automatically identify repeated strokes that represent combination of letters in cursive handwriting. 1.},

A series of stimulations of stratum radiatum during brief tetanic stimulations of stratum oriens resulted in a short-term potentiation (of about 3 min duration) of stratum radiatum-induced CA1 population excitatory postsynaptic potential. Potentiation was evident when the stratum radiatum stimulus preceded the onset of the conditioning tetanus by no more than 50 ms, or followed by no more than 80 ms. These parameters closely resemble those found for associative long-term potentiation, suggesting the possibility of shared mechanisms for the induction of these two forms of potentiation.},

AR parameters are estimated from a signal containing only the alpha, rhythm activity of the EEG. These parameters are used as features in the classification step, which employs a learning vector quantizer network. The proposed method was applied on a set of real EEG recordings made on healthy individuals, in an attempt to experimentally investigate the connection between a person's EEG and genetically-specific information. Correct classification scores at the range of 72\% to 84\% show the potential of our approach for person classification/identification and are in agreement with previous research showing evidence that the EEG carries genetic information},

@article{Rozado2012a,
abstract = {Predefined sequences of eye movements, or â€˜gaze gesturesâ€™, can be consciously performed by humans and monitored non-invasively using remote video oculography. Gaze gestures hold great potential in humanâ€“computer interaction, HCI, as long as they can be easily assimilated by potential users, monitored using low cost gaze tracking equipment and machine learning algorithms are able to distinguish the spatio-temporal structure of intentional gaze gestures from typical gaze activity performed during standard HCI. In this work, an evaluation of the performance of a bioinspired Bayesian pattern recognition algorithm known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) on the real time recognition of gaze gestures is carried out through a user study. To improve the performance of traditional HTM during real time recognition, an extension of the algorithm is proposed in order to adapt HTM to the temporal structure of gaze gestures. The extension consists of an additional top node in the HTM topology that stores and compares sequences of input data by sequence alignment using dynamic programming. The spatio-temporal codification of a gesture in a sequence serves the purpose of handling the temporal evolution of gaze gestures instances. The extended HTM allows for reliable discrimination of intentional gaze gestures from otherwise standard humanâ€“machine gaze interaction reaching up to 98\% recognition accuracy for a data set of 10 categories of gaze gestures, acceptable completion speeds and a low rate of false positives during standard gazeâ€“computer interaction. These positive results despite the low cost hardware employed supports the notion of using gaze gestures as a new HCI paradigm for the fields of accessibility and interaction with smartphones, tablets, projected displays and traditional desktop computers.},

@article{dynamicProgrammingInBioinformatics,
abstract = {Motivation: Dynamic programming is probably the most popular programming
method in bioinformatics. Sequence comparison, gene recognition,
RNA structure prediction and hundreds of other problems are solved
by ever new variants of dynamic programming. Currently, the development
of a successful dynamic programming algorithm is a matter of experience,
talent and luck. The typical matrix recurrence relations that make
up a dynamic programming algorithm are intricate to construct, and
difficult to implement reliably. No general problem independent guidance
is available. Results: This article introduces a systematic method
for constructing dynamic programming solutions to problems in biosequence
analysis. By a conceptual splitting of the algorithm into a recognition
and an evaluation phase, algorithm development is simplified considerably,
and correct recurrences can be derived systematically. Without additional
effort, the method produces an early, executable prototype expressed
in a functional programming language. The method is quite generally
applicable, and, while programming effort decreases, no overhead
in terms of ultimate program efficiency is incurred. Contact: robert@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de},

abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decorrelated features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.},

@article{VanTulder2007,
abstract = {Repetitive strain injury remains a controversial topic. The term repetitive strain injury includes specific disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, and tendonitis of the wrist or hand. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history and clinical examination. Large high-quality studies using newer imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasonography are few. Consequently, the role of such imaging in diagnosis of upper limb disorders remains unclear. In many cases, no specific diagnosis can be established and complaints are labelled as non-specific. Little is known about the effectiveness of treatment options for upper limb disorders. Strong evidence for any intervention is scarce and the effect, if any, is mainly short-term pain relief. Exercise is beneficial for non-specific upper limb disorders. Immobilising hand braces and open carpal tunnel surgery release are beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome, and topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections are helpful for lateral epicondylitis. Exercise is probably beneficial for neck pain, as are corticosteroid injections and exercise for shoulder pain. Although upper limb disorders occur frequently in the working population, most trials have not exclusively included a working population or assessed effects on work-related outcomes. Further high-quality trials should aim to include sufficient sample sizes, working populations, and work-related outcomes.},

abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Understanding the computational and
information processing roles of cortical circuitry is one of the
outstanding problems in neuroscience. In this paper, we work from
a theory of neocortex that models it as a spatio-temporal hierarchical
system to derive a biological cortical circuit. This is achieved
by combining the computational constraints provided by the inference
equations for this spatio-temporal hierarchy with anatomical data.
The result is a mathematically consistent biological circuit that
can be mapped to the cortical laminae and matches many prominent
features of the mammalian neocortex. The mathematical model can serve
as a starting point for the construction of machines that work like
the brain. The resultant biological circuit can be used for modeling
physiological phenomena and for deriving testable predictions about
the brain.</p>},

abstract = {Biometric identification systems, which use physical features to check a person's identity, ensure much greater security than password and number systems. Biometric features such as the face or a fingerprint can be stored on a microchip in a credit card, for example. A single feature, however, sometimes fails to be exact enough for identification. Another disadvantage of using only one feature is that the chosen feature is not always readable. Dialog Communication Systems (DCS AG) developed BioID, a multimodal identification system that uses three different features-face, voice, and lip movement-to identify people. With its three modalities, BioID achieves much greater accuracy than single-feature systems. Even if one modality is somehow disturbed-for example, if a noisy environment drowns out the voice-the ether two modalities still lead to an accurate identification. This article goes into detail about the system functions, explaining the data acquisition and preprocessing techniques for voice, facial, and lip imagery data. The authors also explain the classification principles used for optical features and the sensor fusion options (the combinations of the three results-face, voice, lip movement-to obtain varying levels of security)},

abstract = {The computer mouse is now present in virtually every office environment because of the recent adoption of the graphical user interface. However, Karlqvist et al. (1994) pointed out that there still remains a paucity of work on the musculoskeletal problems associated specifically with computer mouse use. Likewise, there have been no published data on the magnitude of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders associated with computer mouse use. In order to ascertain this magnitude, claims data from the Liberty Mutual Group were reviewed for the years 1986 to 1993, inclusive. Count, total cost and average cost per claim for all claims associated with computer use and computer mouse use were determined for the years in question. It was concluded that although there are few claims related to computer mouse use, it appears to be a growing problem, and therefore, perhaps, deserves more research and intervention attention. However, the present magnitude is less than for other musculoskeletal disorders.},

Data on eye location and details of eye movements have numerous applications and are essential in face detection, biometric identification, and particular human-computer interaction tasks. This paper reviews current progress and state of the art in video-based eye detection and tracking in order to identify promising techniques as well as issues to be further addressed. We present a detailed review of recent eye models and techniques for eye detection and tracking. We also survey methods for gaze estimation and compare them based on their geometric properties and reported accuracies. This review shows that, despite their apparent simplicity, the development of a general eye detection technique involves addressing many challenges, requires further theoretical developments, and is consequently of interest to many other domains problems in computer vision and beyond.},

abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0506162102 In the past decade, cultural differences
in perceptual judgment and memory have been observed: Westerners
attend more to focal objects, whereas East Asians attend more to
contextual information. However, the underlying mechanisms for the
apparent differences in cognitive processing styles have not been
known. In the present study, we examined the possibility that the
cultural differences arise from culturally different viewing patterns
when confronted with a naturalistic scene. We measured the eye movements
of American and Chinese participants while they viewed photographs
with a focal object on a complex background. In fact, the Americans
fixated more on focal objects than did the Chinese, and the Americans
tended to look at the focal object more quickly. In addition, the
Chinese made more saccades to the background than did the Americans.
Thus, it appears that differences in judgment and memory may have
their origins in differences in what is actually attended as people
view a scene.},

abstract = {Knowledge-based authentication (e.g. passwords) has long been associated with a vulnerability to shoulder sur ng; being stolen by attackers overlooking the interaction. In order to combat such threats, steps can be taken to either alter the form of the challenge made to the user, or make use of an interaction technique that is resistant to information leakage. We consider the latter, and empirically evaluate the usability of gaze-contingent interaction as a solution to shoulder surfing in an ATM scenario. We combine this technique with Passfaces graphical passwords; potentially more memorable than PINs and well suited to accept gaze-based input. To create a naturalistic setting for our study we utilise the immersive video technique originally deployed in the design of pervasive computing systems (Singh et al., 2006). We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, a usable graphical password entry system that is impossible to attack by direct observation},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of user's focus point to improve some visual effects in virtual environments (VE). First, we describe how to retrieve user's focus point in the 3D VE using an eye-tracking system. Then, we propose the adaptation of two rendering techniques which aim at improving users' sensations during first-person navigation in VE using his/her focus point: (1) a camera motion which simulates eyes movement when walking, i.e., corresponding to vestibulo-ocular and vestibulocollic reflexes when the eyes compensate body and head movements in order to maintain gaze on a specific target, and (2) a depth-of-field (DoF) blur effect which simulates the fact that humans perceive sharp objects only within some range of distances around the focal distance. Second, we describe the results of an experiment conducted to study users' subjective preferences concerning these visual effects during first-person navigation in VE. It showed that participants globally preferred the use of these effects when they are dynamically adapted to the focus point in the VE. Taken together, our results suggest that the use of visual effects exploiting users' focus point could be used in several VR applications involving first- person navigation such as the visit of architectural site, training simulations, video games, etc.},

in Persian sign language (PSL) using Wavelet transform and neural
networks (NN). The required images for the selected alphabets are
obtained using a digital camera. The color images are cropped, resized,
and converted to grayscale images. Then, the discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) is applied on the gray scale images, and some features are
extracted. Finally, the extracted features are used to train a Multi-Layered
Perceptron (MLP) NN. Our recognition system does not use any gloves
or visual marking systems. This system only requires the images of
the bare hand for the recognition. The system is implemented and
tested using a data set of 640 samples of Persian sign images; 20
images for each sign. Experimental results show that our system is
able to recognize 32 selected PSL alphabets with an average classification
accuracy of 94.06\%.},

@book{hebb1949,
abstract = {Donald Hebb pioneered many current themes in behavioural neuroscience. He saw psychology as a biological science, but one in which the organization of behaviour must remain the central concern. Through penetrating theoretical concepts, including the "cell assembly," "phase sequence," and "Hebb synapse," he offered a way to bridge the gap between cells, circuits and behaviour. He saw the brain as a dynamically organized system of multiple distributed parts, with roots that extend into foundations of development and evolutionary heritage. He understood that behaviour, as brain, can be sliced at various levels and that one of our challenges is to bring these levels into both conceptual and empirical register. He could move between theory and fact with an ease that continues to inspire both students and professional investigators. Although facts continue to accumulate at an accelerating rate in both psychology and neuroscience, and although these facts continue to force revision in the details of Hebb's earlier contributions, his overall insistence that we look at behaviour and brain together ï¿½ within a dynamic, relational and multilayered framework ï¿½ remains. His work touches upon current studies of population coding, contextual factors in brain representations, synaptic plasticity, developmental construction of brain/behaviour relations, clinical syndromes, deterioration of performance with age and disease, and the formal construction of connectionist models. The collection of papers in this volume represent these and related themes that Hebb inspired. We also acknowledge our appreciation for Don Hebb as teacher, colleague and friend.},

@article{useofeyemovementGesturesforwebbrowsing,
abstract = {Web browsing is one of the most common tasks performed by modern day computer users. Any improvement to typical web browser interaction could thus yield a wideranging benefit in terms of user efficiency or satisfaction. Studies have shown the advantages of traditional mousebased gestures in web and hypertext browser applications, so a logical step would be to examine the potential for similar gestures using eye movement interaction. Here we implement such a system and study its effectiveness. Key issues when working with gestures are the quantity and complexity of the implemented gestures. Because of the established shortcomings in using eye gaze tracking for conventional motor control tasks, we severely limit the number of eye movement gestures in our system and constrain them to single-line motions. We believe that this allows our system to apply a more natural mapping between gesture and meaning. We test users in a simulated browser environment conducting a navigation task, comparing our eye movement gestures to traditional point-and-click mouse input. We contend that our eye gesture system compares favorably to mouse input in terms of user performance and satisfaction. Author Keywords Eye movements, eye tracking, gestures, web browsers,},

@article{IJmker2007,
abstract = {Worldwide, millions of office workers use a computer. Reports of adverse health effects due to computer use have received considerable media attention. This systematic review summarises the evidence for a relationship between the duration of work time spent using the computer and the incidence of hand-arm and neck-shoulder symptoms and disorders. Several databases were systematically searched up to 6 November 2005. Two reviewers independently selected articles that presented a risk estimate for the duration of computer use, included an outcome measure related to hand-arm or neck-shoulder symptoms or disorders, and had a longitudinal study design. The strength of the evidence was based on methodological quality and consistency of the results. Nine relevant articles were identified, of which six were rated as high quality. Moderate evidence was concluded for a positive association between the duration of mouse use and hand-arm symptoms. For this association, indications for a dose-response relationship were found. Risk estimates were in general stronger for the hand-arm region than for the neck-shoulder region, and stronger for mouse use than for total computer use and keyboard use. A pathophysiological model focusing on the overuse of muscles during computer use supports these differences. Future studies are needed to improve our understanding of safe levels of computer use by measuring the duration of computer use in a more objective way, differentiating between total computer use, mouse use and keyboard use, attaining sufficient exposure contrast, and collecting data on disability caused by symptoms.},

@article{reviewevolutionarynn,
abstract = {Research on potential interactions between connectionist learning systems, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs), and evolutionary search procedures, like genetic algorithms (GAs), has attracted a lot of attention recently. Evolutionary ANNs (EANNs) can be considered as the combination of ANNs and evolutionary search procedures. This paper first distinguishes among three kinds of evolution in EANNs, i.e., the evolution of connection weights, of architectures and of learning rules. Then it reviews each kind of evolution in detail and analyses critical issues related to different evolutions. The review shows that although a lot of work has been done on the evolution of connection weights and of architectures, few attempts have been made to understand the evolution of learning rules. Interactions among different evolutions are seldom mentioned in current research. However, the evolution of learning rules and its interactions with other kinds of evolution play a vital role in EANNs. As the final part, this paper briefly describes a general framework for EANNs, which not only includes the aforementioned three kinds of evolution, but also considers interactions among them.},

@article{hierarchysupport,
abstract = {This paper addresses the question of the organization of memory processes
within the medial temporal lobe. Evidence obtained in patients with
late-onset amnesia resulting from medial temporal pathology has given
rise to two opposing interpretations of the effects of such damage
on long-term cognitive memory. One view is that cognitive memory,
including memory for both facts and events, is served in a unitary
manner by the hippocampus and its surrounding cortices; the other
is that the basic function affected in amnesia is event memory, the
memory for factual material often showing substantial preservation.
Recent findings in patients with amnesia resulting from relatively
selective hippocampal damage sustained early in life suggest a possible
reconciliation of the two views. The new findings suggest that the
hippocampus may be especially important for event as opposed to fact
memory, with the surrounding cortical areas contributing to both.
Evidence from neuroanatomical and neurobehavioural studies in monkeys
is presented in support of this proposal.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores
allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the
statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm
is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and
applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and
protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification
searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in
long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability
to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than
existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

@book{shepherd2004,
abstract = {It is widely recognized that the neural basis of brain function can be fully understood only by integrating many disciplines at many levels. Studies of synaptic organization are bringing about a quiet revolution in achieving this goal, as documented by this unique book over the past 30 years. In this fifth edition, the results of the mouse and human genome projects are incorporated for the first time. Molecular biologists interested in functional genomics and proteomics of the brain will find answers here to the critical questions: what are the cell and circuit functions of gene products? Also for the first time, the reader is oriented to supporting neuroscience databases. Among the new advances covered are 2-photon confocal laser microscopy of dendrites and dendritic spines, biochemical analyses, and dual patch and multielectrode recordings, applied together with an increasing range of behavioral and gene-targeting methods. Leading experts in the best understood brain regions bring together the molecular, anatomical, functional, and behavioral data in authoritative integrated accounts. The chapters are organized in the same format, covering the neural elements, synaptic connections, basic circuits, physiology, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, membrane properties, dendritic properties, and with a final section on how the circuits mediate specific behaviors. The uniform framework for each chapter enables the authors to higlight the principles that are common to all regions, as well as the adaptations unique to each, thus serving as a model for understanding the neural basis of behavior.},
